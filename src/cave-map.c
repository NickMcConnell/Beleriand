/**
 * This function takes a grid location and extracts information the
 * player is allowed to know about it, filling in the grid_data structure
 * passed in 'g'.
 *
 * The information filled in is as follows:
 *  - g->f_idx is filled in with the terrain's feature type, or FEAT_NONE
 *    if the player doesn't know anything about the grid.  The function
 *    makes use of the "mimic" field in terrain in order to allow one
 *    feature to look like another (hiding secret doors, invisible traps,
 *    etc).  This will return the terrain type the player "Knows" about,
 *    not necessarily the real terrain.
 *  - g->m_idx is set to the monster index, or 0 if there is none (or the
 *    player doesn't know it).
 *  - g->first_kind is set to the object_kind of the first object in a grid
 *    that the player knows about, or NULL for no objects.
 *  - g->first_art is set to the artifact pointer of the first object in a grid
 *    that the player knows about, or NULL if there are no objects or the first
 *    known object is not an artifact.
 *  - g->muliple_objects is true if there is more than one object in the
 *    grid that the player knows and cares about (to facilitate any special
 *    floor stack symbol that might be used).
 *  - g->in_view is true if the player can currently see the grid - this can
 *    be used to indicate field-of-view, such as through the 
 *    OPT(player, view_bright_light) option.
 *  - g->lighting is set to indicate the lighting level for the grid:
 *    LIGHTING_LIT by default, LIGHTING_DARK for unlit but seen grids within the
 *    detection radius of a player with the UNLIGHT ability and a light source
 *    with an intensity of one or less, LIGHTING_TORCH for seen and lit grids
 *    within the radius of the player's light source when the view_yellow_light
 *    option is on, and LIGHTING_LOS for seen and lit grids that don't qualify
 *    for LIGHTING_TORCH.
 *  - g->is_player is true if the player is on the given grid.
 *  - g->hallucinate is true if the player is hallucinating something "strange"
 *    for this grid - this should pick a random monster to show if the m_idx
 *    is non-zero, and a random object if first_kind is non-zero.
 * 
 * NOTES:
 * This is called pretty frequently, whenever a grid on the map display
 * needs updating, so don't overcomplicate it.
 *
 * Terrain is remembered separately from objects and monsters, so can be
 * shown even when the player can't "see" it.  This leads to things like
 * doors out of the player's view still change from closed to open and so on.
 *
 * TODO:
 * Hallucination is a display-level hack (mostly in ui-map.c's
 * grid_data_as_text(); some here) and we need it to be a knowledge-level
 * hack.  The idea is that objects may turn into different objects, monsters
 * into different monsters, and terrain may be objects, monsters, or stay the
 * same.

/**
 * Memorize interesting viewable object/features in the given grid
 *
 * This function should only be called on "legal" grids.
 *
 * This function will memorize the object and/or feature in the given grid,
 * if they are (1) see-able and (2) interesting.  Note that all objects are
 * interesting, all terrain features except floors (and invisible traps) are
 * interesting, and floors (and invisible traps) are interesting sometimes
 * (depending on various options involving the illumination of floor grids).
 *
 * The automatic memorization of all objects and non-floor terrain features
 * as soon as they are displayed allows incredible amounts of optimization
 * in various places, especially "map_info()" and this function itself.
 *
 * Note that the memorization of objects is completely separate from the
 * memorization of terrain features, preventing annoying floor memorization
 * when a detected object is picked up from a dark floor, and object
 * memorization when an object is dropped into a floor grid which is
 * memorized but out-of-sight.
 *
 * This function should be called every time the "memorization" of a grid
 * (or the object in a grid) is called into question, such as when an object
 * is created in a grid, when a terrain feature "changes" from "floor" to
 * "non-floor", and when any grid becomes "see-able" for any reason.
 *
 * This function is called primarily from the "update_view()" function, for
 * each grid which becomes newly "see-able".
