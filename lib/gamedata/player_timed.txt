# File: player_timed.txt

# Used in conjunction with list-player-timed.h
# Timed player properties

# Descriptions, messages and message types can be edited without bad effects.
# Changing fail may have unpredictable results.
# Changing the name, reordering, or adding whole new entries will severely
# disrupt the game, and should only be done when list-player-timed.h
# (and other code) is also  being changed, and the game recompiled.
# Changing a resist line will have to match to one of the hard-coded elements
# from list-elements.h; currently, those resist lines are used to filter out
# unnecessary messages when timed effects lapse and to affect selection of
# randart activations.
# Changing a flag-synonym line will have to match to an entry, of type flag, in
# object_property.txt; those lines are currently used to filter out unnecessary
# messages when timed effects lapse and to affect selection of randart
# activations.

# Fields:
# name - the effect name
# desc - the effect description
# este - 1 if recovery from the effect is affected by Song of Este
# grade - the message on increasing a grade of the effect.  Note that most
#         effects only have two grades (on and off); for these, the message
#         is just the message on beginning the effect
# change-grade - the message on increasing a grade of the effect where the
#                message is based on the amount of change rather than the total
#                of the counter
# on-end - the message on ending the effect
# on-increase - the message on the effect increasing
# on-decrease - the message on the effect decreasing
# msgt - the message type for this effect
# fail - determines what makes the effect fail (after a skill check).
# resist - (optional) when this timed property is active, the recipient gains
#         a temporary resistance to the named element
# flag-synonym - (optional) indicate that this timed property is (largely)
#         synonymous to the object property of type flag in
#         object_property.txt with the code given by the first parameter; if
#         the second parameter is not zero, this timed property is an exact
#         synonym, except for duration; if the second parameter is zero, the
#         timed property has other effects that are not implied by the named
#         object property
