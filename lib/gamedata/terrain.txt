# File: terrain.txt
#
# This file is used to create the "terrain feature" information for Sil.
#
# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.
#
# Note that, unlike other edit files, modifying this file casually is likely
# to be a BAD IDEA (unless you intend to make actual programming changes)
# for two reasons:

#   1. Terrain features do not appear unless there is specific code in the
#   level generation algorithms to include them, so adding new terrain
#   features to this file will by itself have no effect.

#   2. The game uses the names of the standard terrain features
#   ("granite wall", etc) in terrain placement.  Changing the name of a terrain
#   feature can thus stop the game from running; changing its properties will
#   change game behaviour; and any changes during the playing of an individual
#   game are likely to mess it up.
