# file: dungeon_profile.txt

# Contains information about how each type of dungeon level (and the town)
# are generated.

# name: The profile name.  This needs to match the corresponding entry in 
# list-dun-profiles.h so the correct level-building function can be called

# params: block_size : rooms : unusual : rarity
# The dungeon is divided into non-overlapping square blocks of block_size by
# block_size grids.  When rooms are placed, each is assigned a rectangular
# chunk of blocks, and those assignments won't leave a block assigned to more
# than one room (the staircase rooms are an exception to that rule).  So,
# block_size affects how densely the rooms can be packed and the maximum number
# of rooms possible.  rooms is the number of rooms to aim for.  unusual is a
# measure of how likely high rarity roooms are to appear - higher values make
# the rare rooms rarer.  rarity is the maximum rarity room allowed with this
# cave profile.

# tunnel: rnd : chg : con : pen : jct
# These are percentage chances - rnd of choosing a random tunnel direction
# (as opposed to heading in the desired direction), chg the chance of changing
# direction, at any tunnel grid, con the chance of just terminating a tunnel,
# pen the chance of putting a door in a room entrance, jct the chance of a
# door at a tunnel junction.

# streamer: den : rng : qua
# Streamers are drawn as a random walk which stops at the dungeon edge.
# den is the number of grids near any walk grid to make streamer; rng is how
# far from the walk those grids can be; qua is the numbers of quartz streamers
# per level.

# room: name : height : width : level : rarity : cutoff
# name is the room name, which must match the name in list-rooms.h so the 
# correct room-building function can be called.
# height and width are the maximum dimensions of the room, and define how much
# space is allocated for that room.
# level is the minimum depth at which this room can appear.
# rarity is the room's rarity - normally 0, 1 or 2 (see comments about profile
# rarity above).  Some rooms are chosen by a different means; in this case
# rarity is usually 0.
# cutoff is used to pick between rooms once a rarity is chosen:  a random value
# from 0 to 99 is selected and a room may appear if its cutoff is greater than
# that value.  Non-zero cutoffs normally appear in ascending order within the
# rooms of the same rarity for a given profile.  A room with a smaller cutoff
# appearing after one with a larger cutoff will only be selected if an attempt
# to place the earlier room fails.  One way that can happen is because of the
# depth restrictions set in this file.  For greater vaults and huge rooms,
# there are also restrictions in the code that make their generation fail
# frequently.
