# Summon type details

# Fields:
# name      - summon type name
# msgt      - message type
# uniques   - whether uniques are allowed
# base      - allowed monster bases if any
# race-flag - allowed racial flag if any
# fallback  - summon type to substitute on failure
# desc      - description

# 'name' is the code used to refer to the summon type, and should begin every
# entry

# 'msgt' is the message type used to display the message, which may affect any
# sound played on the summon happening

# 'uniques' is 1 if the summon type allows uniques to be summoned, 0 otherwise.
# Traditionally UNIQUE and WRAITH will summon uniques, ANY, HI_UNDEAD, HI_DEMON
# and HI_DRAGON may summon uniques, and none of the other summon codes will ever
# summon uniques.

# 'base' indicates a possible monster base for the summon.  If a summon type
# has no base: line, any monster base can be chosen, otherwise only the given
# monster bases can be chosen.

# 'race-flag' indicates a possible race flag for the summon.  If a summon type
# has no race-flag: line, there are no flag-based restrictions, otherwise
# only monsters with the given flag can be chosen.

# 'fallback' gives the name of another summon type to try if the given type
# fails to summon any monsters.  Traditionally the only summon types with a
# fallback are WRAITH and UNIQUE, which both fall back to HI_UNDEAD.

# 'desc' is the description of the summon type used in messages.

# Note also that the ANY summon should always be the first in this file.
