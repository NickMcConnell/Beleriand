# File: tutorial.txt


# This file is used to define the tutorial sections for the game.  The related
# source code for parsing this file and implementing tutorial mode is in
# tutorial.c, tutorial-init.c, and ui-tutorial.c.  The primary way the rest of
# the game interacts with the tutorial mode is by calling start_tutorial() or
# in_tutorial().  start_tutorial() will load the tutorial section marked as
# the default in this file.  If no section has been marked as the default,
# start_tutorial() will load the first section in this file.

# Modifications to this file should only impact the tutorial mode and have
# no effect on the rest of the game or savefiles.

# Like vault.txt, the "spacing" in the "D:" lines is very important!

# === Archetype ==

# An archetype defines a character to be used in the tutorial.  When entering
# the tutorial mode, the character will be set to the archetype marked as the
# default, or if none has been marked as the default, the first archetype
# defined in this file.  If there are no archetypes defined, the character
# used for the tutorial will come from the first race and house for that race,
# have a random name and history, no investment in skills beyond the base
# values, no abilities, and the default starting experience.  The description
# of an archetype begins with an "archetype:" line and continues until the
# next "archetype:", "note:", "trigger:" or "section:" line.  The ability to
# have multiple archetypes is a holdover from a design that would allow the
# character to be switched out between tutorial sections.  As that's not
# implemented, you really should define only one archetype.

# The lines defining an archetype are:

# archetype:name
# Sets the name of the archetype to be what appears after the first colon.
# That name must not match the name of one of the other archetypes.

# race:name
# (Optional) Is the name of the race, from race.txt, to use for characters
# of this archetype.  If name is "*", a random race will be selected each time
# a character of this archetype is created.  If there is no "race:" line,
# the first available race will be used.

# house:name
# (Optional) Is the short name of the house, from house.txt, to use for
# characters of this archetype.  If name is "*", a random house will be
# selected each time a character of this archetype is created.  If there
# is no "house:" line, the first available house will be used.

# name:character_name
# (Optional) Is the name to use for characters of this archetype.  If the name
# is "*" or no "name:" line is given, a random name will be generated each
# time a character of this archetype is created for the tutorial.

# sex:character_sex
# (Optional) Is the sex to use for characters of this archetype.  What follows
# after the colon must be "Male", "Female", or "*".  If the sex is "*" or no
# "sex:" line is given, a random sex will be generated each time a character
# of this archetype is created for the tutorial.

# experience:unspent_amount
# (Optional) Is the amount of unused experience that character of this
# archetype will start with.  The amount must be an integer greater than or
# equal to zero.  If no "experience:" line is given, characters of this
# archetype will start with whatever experience remains after buying the
# skills and abilities given by the "skills:" and "abilities:" directives.

# stats: ...
# (Optional) Sets the amount to add to one or more of the core statistics
# for characters of this archetype.  What follows the colon should be one
# or more names of statistics (the name must be one of the names from
# list-stats.h) where the names are separated by whitespace or '|' and
# immediately following each name is the amount to add to the statistic in
# brackets.  More than one "stats:" lines may be given:  all the adjustments
# from those lines will be applied to characters of this archetype.

# skills: ...
# (Optional) Sets the amount to add to one or more of the skills for
# characters of this archetype.  What follows the colon should be one
# or more names of skills (a name must be the first argument to one of the
# SKILL() macros in list-skills.h) where the names are separated by whitespace
# or '|'s and immediately following each name is the amount to add to the
# skill in brackets.  More than one "skills:" line may be given:  all the skill
# adjustments from those lines will be applied to characters of this archetype.

# abilities: ...
# (Optional) Sets the abilities that characters of this archetype should
# start out knowing.  What follows the colon should be one or more
# names of skills (a name must be the first argument to one of the SKILL()
# macros in list-skills.h) where the names are separated by whitespace or
# '|'s and immediately following each skill name is the name of the ability
# to know (name must be one of those given in the "Name:" directives in
# ability.txt) from that skill enclosed in brackets.  More than one "abilities:"
# line may be given:  all the abilities from those lines will be applied to
# characters of this archetype.  The abilities are applied in the order they
# appear.  Prequisite abilities for an ability are not automatically added so
# those prequisites must appear in the list before the ability that depends on
# them.

# history:text
# (Optional) Is the history to use for characters of this archetype.  Multiple
# history lines for the same archetype will be concatenated.  If the history
# is "*" or no "history:" line is given, a random history will be generated
# each time a character of this archetype is created for the tutorial.

# object:tval:sval:number:equipped
# (Optional) Adds a stack to the starting kit for characters of this
# archetype.  tval is the class of object to add (i.e. the name of one of
# the classes in object_base.txt).  sval is the name of a type of object in
# object.txt that belongs to that class.  number is a dice expression for
# the number to appear in the stack.  equipped should be yes or no.  If yes,
# an item from the stack will be equipped, if possible.  You may specify as
# many object lines as you wish to add multiple stacks to the starting kit.
# If adding a stack would exceed the character's pack size, the stack will be
# ignored.

# complex-object:tval:sval:number:equipped:special:properties:modifiers
# (Optional) Adds a stack to the starting kit for characters of this
# archetype.  Allows more control (mostly for objects the can be worn or
# ammunition) for the properties of the object in the stack.  tval is the
# class of object to add (i.e. the name of one of the classes in
# object_base.txt).  sval is the name of a type of object in object.txt that
# belongs to that class.  number is a dice expression for the number to appear
# in the stack.  equipped should be yes or no.  If yes, an item from the stack
# will be equipped, if possible.  special is NONE or the name of an enchantment
# from special.txt to apply to the objects in the stack. properties is a list
# of names, separated by whitespace or |, for properties to apply to the stack.
# A recognized property name will be one of the following:
#   a) NONE
#   b) a code value (for instance, PROT_FEAR) for a property of type flag, slay
#      or brand in object_property.txt
#   c) IGNORE_ prepended to an element name from list-elements.h.
#   d) HATES_ prepended to an element name from list-elements.h.
# modifiers is a list of names, separated by whitepace or |, for modifiers
# to apply to the stack.  Each name in the list is a string identifying the
# modifier to change followed by [dice] where dice is a dice expression for
# the value of the modifier.  For the special case of the PVAL modifier, the
# dice expression can include $N which will be replaced by the number of
# objects in the stack.  A recognized identifier for a modifier will be one
# of the following:
#   a) NONE
#   b) PVAL to modify the pval for the objects.
#   c) a code value (for instance, STR) for a property of type stat, skill,
#      or mod in object_property.txt.
#   d) RES_ prepended to an element name from list-elements.h.  The modifier
#      value for those should correspond to the desired resistance level:  -1
#      for vulnerable or 1 for resistant.
# You may specify as many complex-object lines as you wish to add multiple
# stacks to the starting kit.  If adding a stack would exceed the character's
# pack size, the stack will be ignored.

# artifact:name:equipped
# (Optional) Adds an artifact to the starting kit for characters of this
# archetype.  name is the name, from artifact.txt, for the artifact to add.
# equipped should be yes or no; if yes, the artifact will be equipped, if
# possible.  You may specify as many artifact lines as you wish to add
# multiple stacks to the starting kit.  If adding a stack would exceed the
# character's pack size, the stack will be ignored.  artifact lines are not
# allowed to break the restriction that only one copy of an artifact can
# exist per game.  So, if an artifact has already been created since the
# tutorial was started, it will not be allowed to be created again.
#
# flags: ...
# (Optional) Is a list of flag names, separated by whitespace or |, to apply
# to this archetype.  The flag names currently understood are:
# DEFAULT
#   Mark this archetype as the default.  If no archetypes are marked as default
#   the first one that appears in tutorial.txt will implicitly be the default.
# PURGE_NORMAL_KIT
#   Remove the normal starting kit (from race.txt) before adding the items
#   specified for the archetype.

# === Note ===

# A note is a special object with a tval of "note", sval of "tutorial note",
# and a pval that serves as an index for message lookup.  Because a pval is
# used for message lookup, at most 32767 distinct kinds of notes are possible.
# In the tutorial, moving the character to the grid containing an object
# whose base kind is the note will cause a message to appear.  It would be
# cleaner to specify a note directly in each tuturial section that uses it,
# but describing it separately allows for the note's text to be split over
# multiple lines in this file.  The description of a note begins with a
# "note:" line and continues until the next "note:", "archetype:", "trigger:",
# or "section:" line.

# The lines defining a note are:

# note:name
# Sets the name of the note to be the text that appears after the colon.
# A tutorial section will refer to a note by specifying its name.

# text: ...
# Appends what appears after the colon to the text for the note.  You may
# specify more than one text line.  They will be appended in the order they
# appear.  Within the text, these expressions (left bracket, followed by a name
# specifying the expression type, then the arguments, if any, each preceded by
# a colon, and then a right bracket) are expanded:
#   {command:name}
#   {commanding:name}
#   {Command:name}
#   {Commanding:name}
#      Is replaced by a brief phrase (like "press 'd'") describing how to
#      invoke the command with the given name.  For the textui interface,
#      the command names are those listed ui-game.c.  The first two forms
#      start the phrase with a lowercase letter.  The last two forms
#      capitalize the first letter.  The "commanding" and "Commanding" forms
#      use a gerund phrase, so something like "pressing 'd'".
#   {direction:name}
#   {directioning:name}
#   {Direction:name}
#   {Directioning:name}
#      Is replaced by a brief phrase describing how to move in the given
#      direction.  The directions understood are north (i.e. vertically
#      towards the top edge of the screen), northeast, east (i.e.
#      horizontally towards the right edge of the screen), southeast,
#      south (i.e. vertically towards the bottom edge of the screen),
#      southwest, west (i.e. horizontally towards the left edge of the
#      screen), northwest, and stay (don't move).  The first two forms
#      start the phrase with a lowercase letter.  The last two forms
#      capitalize the first letter.  The "directioning" and "Directioning"
#      forms use a gerund phrase.
#   {direction-rose}
#      Is replaced by a description of how to move in all directions.
#   {feature:name}
#      If possible, is replaced by the symbol ("('+')" for a closed
#      door as an example) for a dungeon feature.  The feature should
#      be one of those described in terrain.txt.
#   {house} or {House}
#      Is replaced by the name of the character's house.  The first form
#      starts the house with a lowercase letter.  The latter capitalizes
#      the first letter.
#   {name}
#      Is replaced by the character's full name.
#   {monster:name}
#      If possible, is replaced by the symbol ("('o')" for an orc as an
#      example) for a monster.  The monster's race should be one of those
#      described in monster.txt.
#   {object:tval:sval}
#      Is replaced by the symbol ("('~')" for a torch as an example)
#      for an object.  The tval should be a name of a class of objects
#      in object_base.txt.  The sval should be the name, from object.txt,
#      for a type of object from that class or * to use the first object
#      type of that class.
#   {paragraphbreak}
#      Is replaced by two newlines (one to end the current line and one
#      to leave space between that line and what follows).
#   {race}
#   {Race}
#      Is replaced by the name of the character's race.  The first form
#      starts the race with a lowercase letter.  The latter capitalizes
#      the first letter.
# If you want a colon that is not to be interpreted as an argument separator
# or a right bracket that is not to be interpreted as the end of an argument
# list, escape it with a backslash.  If you want a backslash, repeat it.
# If you want to use one of those expressions without having it expanded, place
# a backslash immediately before the left bracket: \{feature... for instance.

# === Trigger ===

# A trigger allows a message to be displayed when the character enters a grid
# if some condition is met.  If that condition is met, it will, optionally,
# change the message that will be displayed if the character dies in the
# tutorial.  Unlike a note, a trigger is not an object and won't be visible to
# the player.  It would be cleaner to specify a trigger directly in each
# tuturial section that uses it, but describing it separately allows for the
# trigger's text to be split over multiple lines in this file.  The description
# of a trigger begins with a "trigger:" line and continues until the next
# "trigger:", "archetype:", "note:", or "section:" line.

# The lines describing a trigger are:

# trigger:name
# Sets the name of the trigger to be the text that appears after the colon.
# A tutorial section will refer to a trigger by specifying its name.

# condition:expression
# Defines the condition that has to be true for the text to be displayed.
# The expression after the colon is a series of boolean expressions joined
# by and, xor, or or and grouped by parentheses.  Allowed boolean expressions
# are:
#     not <another expression>
#         Is true if <another expression> is false and false if
#         <another expression> is true.
#     {ability:skill_name:ability_name}
#         Is true if the player has the ability with the given name in the
#         given skill; otherwise, it is false.
#     {carried:tval:sval}
#         Is true if the character has an item in the pack, quiver, or equipped
#         whose tval and sval and sval matches the names given; otherwise, it is
#         false.  tval can be any of the names for object categories in
#         object_base.txt.  sval can be *, to match any possible object type
#         the given tval, or the name of one of the object types in object.txt.
#     {drained:name}
#         Is true if the named quantity for the character is at less than the
#         maximum; otherwise, it is false.  name may be HEALTH, VOICE, or one
#         of the statistic names in list-stats.h.
#     {equipped:tval:sval}
#         Is true if the character has an item equipped whose tval and sval
#         matches the names given; otherwise, it is false.  tval and sval have
#         the same meaning as for {carried}.
#     {false}
#         Always evaluates to false.
#     {timed:name}, {timed:name:above:grade}, {timed:name:below:grade}
#         The first form is true if the character is subject to the timed
#         effect given by the name; otherwise, it is false.  The name should
#         match one of the names in player_timed.txt.  The second form is
#         true if character is subject to a gradation of the given timed
#         that is greater than the grade given after "above:".  The grade
#         should be a name that is a third argument to one of the "grade:"
#         directives in player_timed.txt for the timed effect.  The third form
#         is true if character is subject to a gradation of the given timed
#         effect that is less than the grade given after "below:".
#     {true}
#         Always evaluates to be true.
# A colon that you do want to be interpreted as an argument separator or a
# right bracket that you don't want to be interpreted as the end of an argument
# list can be escaped with a backslash.  To include a backslash, repeat it.

# text:...
# (Optional) Appends what appears after the colon to the text that will be
# displayed when the trigger's condition is true.  You may specify more than
# one text line.  They will be appended in the order they appear.  Within the
# text, the same expressions as for notes will be expanded.  See the description
# of notes for mote details about those expressions.

# death-note:name
# (Optional) If specified and the trigger's condition is true, changes the
# message displayed when the character dies in the tutorial to be the message
# for the note with the given name.  If the name is not given, no message will
# be displayed when the character dies in the tutorial.

# === Section ===

# Describes one section of the tutorial.  The description of a section begins
# with a "section:" line and continues until the next "section:",
# "archetype:", or "note:" line.

# The lines defining a section are:

# section:name
# Creates a new tutorial section.  What appears after the colon is the name
# that can be used to refer to this section of the tutorial.  That name must
# not be EXIT, which is reserved.

# rows:number of rows
# Sets the number of rows to expect in the description ("D:") lines.  The
# number must be a positive integer.  If it is more than world:dungeon-hgt
# minus two from constants.txt, the section can not be loaded when the game
# is in tutorial mode.  Note, that what is described in the description lines
# is automatically enclosed in a one grid thick boundary of permanent rock
# so you do not have to include such a barrier.

# columns:number of columns
# Sets the number of columns to expect in the description ("D:") lines. The
# number must be a positive integer.  If it is more than world:dungeon-wid
# minus two from constants.txt, the section can not be loaded when the game
# is in tutorial mode.  Note, that what is described in the description lines
# is automatically enclosed in a one grid thick boundary of permanent rock
# so you do not have to include such a barrier.

# area-flag:c-upper-left:r-upper-left:c-lower-right:r-lower-right:flags
# (Optional) Marks an area of the tutorial with one or more of the flags
# from list-square-flags.h.  c-upper-left and r-upper-left are the horizontal
# (i.e. column) and vertical (i.e. row), respectively, coordinates for the
# upper left corner of the area.  c-lower-right and r-lower-right are the
# horizontal and vertical, respectively, coordinates for the lower right corner
# of the area.  Horizontal coordinates are integers between -1 (that corresponds
# to the automatically-generated permanent rock just before the first column
# in the description) and the number of columns set in the "columns:" line (that
# corresponds to the automatically-generated permanent rock just after the
# last column in the description).  A horizontal coordinate of zero
# corresponds to the first column in the description, and a horizontal
# coordinate equal to the number of columns minus one corresponds to the last
# column in the description.  Vertical coordinates are integers between -1
# (that corresponds to the automatically-generated permanent rock just before
# the first row in the description) and the number of rows set in the
# "rows:" line (that corresponds to the automatically-generated permanent rock
# immediately after the last row in the description).  A vertical coordinate
# of zero corresponds to the first column in the description, and a vertical
# coordinate equal to the number of rows minus one corresponds to the last
# row in the description.  flags is a list of names, separated by whitespace
# or |, for the square flags to apply to the area.  Each name must be one
# of the first arguments to SQUARE() in list-square-flags.h (for instance,
# GLOW and ROOM are useful).  Note that some flags (TRAP and INVIS, for
# instance) can interfere with other tutorial features.  You may use as many
# area-flag lines as you wish to specify multiple, possibly overlapping, areas
# to mark.

# clear-area-flag:c-upper-left:r-upper-left:c-lower-right:r-lower-right:flags
# (Optional) This is essentially identical to an area-flag line, but instead
# of setting the given flags for the area, it removes those flags if they are
# already set.

# start-note:name
# (Optional) Sets the note, by its name, that will be at the starting
# location ('0' in the description) for the character in this section of
# the tutorial.

# death-note:name
# (Optional) Sets the note, by its name, that will be displayed (unless
# it was replaced by the character passing over a trigger) when the character
# dies while in this section of the tutorial.

# place-note:symbol:name
# (Optional) Causes a note, looked up by name, to be placed at a location the
# description marks with the given symbol.  symbol must either be a single
# character (you can use any single Unicode code point except those used
# for the predefined symbols mentioned for the "D:" lines, encoded in UTF-8, if
# you wish) or a single character (again any single Unicode code point except
# those with predefined meanings for "D:" lines is allowed) followed by (c,r)
# where c and r are integer coordinates using the same system as described for
# the area-flag line.  The latter format, for instance F(10,12), says that the
# F at column 10 and row 12 in the description will use the given note.  The
# other format, say F, says that all occurences of 'F' in the description will
# use the given note unless they have been assigned a note by the more
# specific format.

# place-trigger:symbol:name
# (Optional) Causes a trigger, looked up by name, to be placed at a location
# the description marks with the given symbol.  symbol has the same meaning
# as it does for "place-note:" lines:  it defines the symbol in the
# description where the trigger will be placed.

# gate:symbol:destination:terrain to use:note
# Creates a gateway that either leads to another section of the tutorial or
# causes the player to exit tutorial mode.  Every tutorial section must have
# at least one gateway, and can have more than one.  symbol has the same meaning
# as it does for "place-note:" lines:  it defines the symbol in the description
# where the gate will be placed.  destination is either EXIT, which will cause
# the player to leave the tutorial when the player's character enters the
# gateway, or the name of the tutorial section that is target for the gateway.
# terrain to use is the name of the terrain type to use for the gateway.  It
# must be one of the terrain types in terrain.txt.  The usual, and highly
# recommended choices, for the terrain type are "up staircase" and "down
# staircase" where the player can trigger the gateway by using the command
# to use the staircase.  If there are other terrain types that act like stairs
# (entering the terrain automatically triggers a level change or a given
# command issued when on that terrain triggers a level change) those could
# also be used.  note is optional.  It is the name of a note whose message
# will be displayed when the player uses the gateway.

# forge:symbol:uses:type
# (Optional) Causes a forge to be placed at a location the description marks
# with the given symbol.  symbol has the same meaning as it does for
# "place-note:" lines:  it defines the symbol in the description where the
# forge will be placed.  uses is the number of times the forge can be used.
# type must either be NORMAL, ENCHANTED, or UNIQUE.

# place-object:symbol:tval:sval:number
# (Optional) Causes a stack of objects to be placed at a location the
# description marks with the given symbol.  symbol has the same meaning as it
# does for "place-note:" lines:  it defines the symbol in the description where
# the stack will be placed.  tval is the name of the object category, from
# object_base.txt, for the type of objects in the stack.  sval is the name
# of the specific object kind, from object.txt, for the type of objects in the
# stack.  number is a dice expression for the number of objects in the stack.

# place-complex-object:symbol:tval:sval:number:special:properties:modifiers
# (Optional) Causes a stack of objects to be placed at a location the
# description marks with the given symbol.  Allows more control of the object
# properties than "place-object:".  symbol has the same meaning as it does for
# "place-note:" lines:  it defines the symbol in the description where the
# the stack will be placed.  tval is the name of the object category, from
# object_base.txt, for the type of objects in the stack.  sval is the name
# of the specific object kind, from object.txt, for the type of objects in the
# stack.  number is a dice expression for the number of objects in the stack.
# special is NONE or the name of an enchantment from special.txt to apply to the
# objects in the stack. properties is a list of names, separated by whitespace
# or |, for properties to apply to the stack.  A recognized property name will
# be one of the following:
#   a) NONE
#   b) a code value (for instance, PROT_FEAR) for a property of type flag, slay
#      or brand in object_property.txt
#   c) IGNORE_ prepended to an element name from list-elements.h.
#   d) HATES_ prepended to an element name from list-elements.h.
# modifiers is a list of names, separated by whitepace or |, for modifiers
# to apply to the stack.  Each name in the list is a string identifying the
# modifier to change followed by [dice] where dice is a dice expression for
# the value of the modifier.  For the special case of the PVAL modifier, the
# dice expression can include $N which will be replaced by the number of objects
# in the stack.  A recognized identifier for a modifier will be
# one of the following:
#   a) NONE
#   b) PVAL to modify the pval for the objects.
#   c) a code value (for instance, STR) for a property of type stat, skill or
#      mod in object_property.txt.
#   d) RES_ prepended to an element name from list-elements.h.  The modifier
#      value for those should correspond to the desired resistance level:  -1
#      for vulnerable or 1 for resistant.

# place-artifact:symbol:name
# (Optional) Causes an artifact to be placed at a location the description
# marks with the given symbol.  symbol has the same meaning as it does for
# "place-note:" lines:  it defines the symbol in the description where the
# the artifact will be placed.  The artifact used is the one with the given
# name from artefact.txt.  If the artifact has already been created, it
# will not be placed at the given symbol.

# monster:symbol:race:alertness:note
# (Optional) Causes a monster to be placed at a location the description
# marks with the given symbol.  symbol has the same meaning as it does for
# "place-note:" lines:  it defines the symbol in the description where the
# the monster will be placed.  race specifies the type of monster to place.
# It must be one of the types named in monster.txt.  Using a unique monster
# may not work:  if that monster is already present in the tutorial section
# or was killed earlier in the tutorial, it will not be placed.  alertness
# specifies how awake the monster is when the character enters the tutorial.
# It may be ALERT, ASLEEP (at the default random sleepiness specified by the
# monsters race), or a numeric value between -20 (very asleep) to 20 (most
# alert.  note is optional (you may omit it and the preceding colon).  If
# present, it names the tutorial note that will be placed in the monster's
# inventory, to be dropped when the monster dies.

# trap:symbol:name:flags
# (Optional) Causes a trap to be placed at a location the description marks
# with the given symbol.  symbol has the same meaning as it does for
# "place-note:" lines:  it defines the symbol in the description where the
# trap will be placed.  name specifies the type of trap to place.  It must
# match one of the short description strings in trap.txt; note that some
# traps (like trap doors) will be silently ignored in the tutorial.  flags
# is optional and consists of one or more of the following, separated by
# whitespace or |, to control the visibility of the trap:
# NONE
#     Does not modify the trap; you can use it you don't want to omit the
#     flags field but want the default trap visibility.
# VISIBLE
#     The trap will start out visible and does not need to be detected by the
#     player.
# INVISIBLE
#     Makes the trap so it won't be detected by merely observing the trap's
#     location.  Does not affect the action of trap detection spells or
#     devices.

# door:symbol:flags
# (Optional) Causes a door to be placed at a location the description marks
# with the given symbol.  By default, the door is closed and not locked.
# symbol has the same meaning as it does for "place-note:" lines:  it defines
# the symbol in the description where the door will be placed.  flags is
# optional and consists of one or more of the following, separated by
# whitespace or |, to control the aspects of the door:
# NONE:
#     Does not modify the door; you can use it you don't want to omit the
#     flags field but want a default closed and unlocked door.
# BROKEN:
#     Specifies a broken door.  Incompatible with NONE, OPEN, CLOSED, SECRET,
#     LOCK_*, and STUCK_*.
# OPEN:
#     Specifies an open door.  Incompatible with NONE, BROKEN, CLOSED, SECRET,
#     LOCK_*, and STUCK_*.
# CLOSED:
#     Specifies a closed, but not secret door.  Incompatible with BROKEN,
#     OPEN, and SECRET.
# SECRET:
#     Specifies a secret door.  Incompatible with NONE, BROKEN, OPEN, CLOSED,
#     LOCK_*, and STUCK_*.
# LOCK_1, LOCK_2, LOCK_5, LOCK_10, LOCK_20, LOCK_50:
#     Marks the door as locked and sets the difficulty for opening it.
#     Incompatible with BROKEN, OPEN, SECRET, and STUCK_*.  The difficulty
#     accumulates so a door with LOCK_1 | LOCK_2 | LOCK_5 | LOCK_10 | LOCK_20
#     would have a strength of 38.  Note that traditional Sil has lock
#     difficulties between 1 and 7, inclusive.
# STUCK_1, STUCK_2, STUCK_5, STUCK_10, STUCK_20, STUCK_50:
#     Marks the door as stuck and sets the difficulty for opening it.
#     Incompatible with BROKEN, OPEN, SECRET, and STUCK_*.  The difficulty
#     accumulates so a door with STUCK_1 | STUCK_2 | STUCK_5 | STUCK_10 |
#     would have a strength of 38.  Note that traditional Sil has stuck
#     difficulties between 1 and 7, inclusive.
# Note, using custom doors is likely unnecessary unless you want broken,
# locked, or stuck doors:  there are predefined symbols to get open, closed and
# unlocked, or secret and unlocked doors.

# flags: ...
# (Optional) Is a list of flag names, separated by whitespace or |, to apply
# to this section.  The flag names currently understood are:
# DEFAULT
#   Mark this section as the default.  If no sections are marked as default
#   the first one that appears in tutorial.txt will implicitly be the default.

# D:line of tutorial layout
# Describes one row of a section's dungeon.  The lines are used in the order
# of their appearance, describing the section's dungeon from the top to the
# bottom.  All such lines must appear after the "rows:" and "columns:" lines
# for the section.  The number of those lines must match the number of rows
# set for the tutorial section.  The text following "D:" up to the end of the
# line is expected to have exactly as many characters as the number of columns
# specified for the section.  Each character may be one of the symbols
# declared by the "place-note:", "gate:", "forge:", "object:",
# "complex-object:", "artifact:", "monster:" or "trap:" lines.  A character
# may also be one of these, many of which have the same meaning as they do
# in the description lines in vault.txt or room_template.txt:
#     0 - Is the starting location for the player's character in the tutorial.
#         Must appear exactly once in all the description lines for the
#         section.
#     . open floor
#     # or space - granite
#     @ - impenetrable rock
#     : - impassable rubble
#     + - Is a closed door.  For this and the other door types, custom-defined
#         symbols set by "door:" lines could be used to allow locking of a
#         closed or secret door or to specify a broken door.
#     , - open door
#     s - secret door
#     ^ - Is a randomly generated trap.  To include a trap but with more
#         control over it, use a "trap:" line and then include the symbol
#         declared there in the layout.

note:welcome note
text:Welcome to Sil. The game is set within a vast dungeon called Angband.
text: You have journeyed far into the north to reach Angband, and at
text: great cost have found your way in. You plan to descend 1,000 ft
text: into the earth, to find the dark enemy Morgoth and to cut a
text: Silmaril from his crown, so that its light might once again be free.
text:{paragraphbreak}As with many other Roguelike games, Sil's graphics are
text: represented by text: you are the {monster:<player>}, the
text: {feature:closed door} is a door, the {object:note:tutorial note} is
text: a note and the {feature:granite wall} are walls. Try moving around with
text: the keypad or arrow keys to reach the note. (You may need to press
text: Numlock if your keypad doesn't work).

note:default death note
text:You have been slain.
text:{paragraphbreak}A key feature of Sil (and all Roguelike games) is that
text: you cannot use savepoints: if you die, that's it! It is thus a
text: challenging game where you need to really *think*.
text:{paragraphbreak}However, it is a bit frustrating to die before the end of
text: the tutorial, so we evidently made it a bit too deadly.
text:{paragraphbreak}Just restart the tutorial and you should be back to where
text: you were in a couple of minutes. Remember that if combat is not going
text: your way, you can try to escape and heal, then either come back again
text: to defeat your adversary or simply ignore it.

note:advanced death note
text:Congratulations you have finished the tutorial.
text:{paragraphbreak}You have also just been through a rite of passage: dying.
text: Remember that a key feature of Sil (and all Roguelike games)
text: is that you cannot use savepoints: if you die, that's it.
text: It is thus a challenging game where you need to really *think*.
text: You will die many times. When you do: reflect on what to learn
text: from that death, see if you set a high score, then think about
text: all the things you want to do differently with the next character...
text:{paragraphbreak}You are now more than ready to create a character and
text: start playing.
text:{paragraphbreak}Don't let the choices overwhelm you the first time.
text: Just start with the default Race and House, then invest most
text: of your starting experience in Melee and Evasion.
text: Once the game begins, finding some weapons and armour should
text: be your top priority.

note:door note
text:To proceed, you will need to go through that door. To open a door, just
text: try to move into it. Some doors are locked, in which case you will
text: need to try multiple times in order to pick the lock. Alternatively,
text: you could try bashing down the door by {commanding:Bash a door}.
text: Some doors are stuck, in which case bashing them down is the only way
text: past.

note:object note
text:There are many different types of objects, which are represented
text: by punctuation symbols. For example the {object:sword:Curved Sword} is
text: a sword text: and the {object:soft armor:Leather Armour} is a piece of
text: armour. To pick them up, walk onto them and {command:Pick up objects}.
text: To drop an object, {command:Drop an item}.

note:inventory note
text:Once you have got the items, they will be in your inventory.
text: Your inventory is displayed in a window to the right of the main map.
text: If you cannot see this window, you can also view the inventory
text: by {commanding:Display inventory listing}.

note:equipment note
text:Now that you can view your inventory, try equipping your
text: sword and armour. To do this, {command:Wear/wield an item}
text: to equip an item, followed by the inventory letter of the
text: item you wish to equip. When you have equipped both sword
text: and armour, they will disappear from your inventory and
text: appear in your equipment list (in a window to the right).
text: You can also {command:Display equipment listing} to view
text: the equipment list.

note:combat note
text:You are now ready to try some combat. Creatures in Sil are usually
text: represented by letters of the alphabet. In the next room
text: lies the least fearsome enemy in the game: the tanglethorn.
text: It cannot move, so simply walk up to it and move into it
text: to attack. However, remember that in Sil death is final.
text: If things start going badly, you can always retreat.

note:combat manual note
text:To find out everything else you need to know about combat,
text: you should read the appropriate pages in the manual
text: that comes with the game. This is not essential for
text: your first few games, but will help you explore the
text: rich tactical combat sytem in Sil.

note:secret door note
text:There is no obvious way out of this room, but there might be a
text: secret door somewhere. {Commanding:Stand still} or {directioning:stay}
text: waits a single turn and also increases your natural searching
text: ability. Try walking around the wall of the room and searching
text: for a secret door. You can also rest until healed by
text: {commanding:Rest for a while}. That might be useful after that
text: fight.

note:bow note
text:The {object:bow:*} here is a bow, and the {object:arrow:*} is a set
text: of arrows. Pick them up by {commanding:Pick up objects}, then wield
text: them both by {commanding:Wear/wield an item}. You can now fire arrows
text: by {commanding:Fire your missile weapon}. Try this in the next room.

note:running note
text:If you want to move a long distance, hold down Shift while you
text: move (or {command:Start running} before moving). This moves you
text: continuously until something happens which needs your attention.
text: It can even run around corners in corridors. Try it.

note:light note
text:Corridors and some rooms like this one are not lit, forcing you
text: to rely on your torch or lantern for light. Darkness and light
text: are major themes in Sil.

note:weapon values note
text:You have found a shortsword. Note that it is listed as a Shorsword
text: (+0,1d7) [+1]. The numbers given in round brackets are attack values,
text: and those in square brackets are defence. This shortsword gives no
text: bonus to hit, does a single seven sided die of damage and gives a
text: +1 bonus to evasion. In contrast, your curved sword has -1 to attack,
text: does two five sided dice of damage and has the same bonus to evasion.
text:{paragraphbreak}This shortsword is also marked \{special}. This means
text: that it bears some unknown enchantment. You will have to discover what
text: that is. For now try wielding it: {command:Wear/wield an item}.

note:armor values note
text:Here is a set of Gauntlets (-1) [+0,1d1]. This means that they
text: give a penalty of -1 to your attacks, they have no bonus to evasion
text: and they absorb 1 point of damage (a one sided die worth...).
text: In contrast, your Leather Armor [-1,1d4] has a -1 penalty to evasion
text: and absorbs one four sided die of damage. As you can see, armour and
text: weapons in Sil come with trade-offs between attack (chance of hitting;
text: damage), and defence (chance of evading hits; damage reduction).
text: Which pieces of equipment are best will depend on the circumstances.

note:Gondolin note
text:If you were wielding the shortsword, you would have noticed it glow
text: brightly in the presence of the orc, indicating to the perceptive player
text: that it bears an enchantment agaist orcs. This means that it does an
text: extra die of damage against orcs, making its 1d7 into 2d7: a large bonus.

note:trap note
text:The dungeons of Angband are littered with many traps. Near here is a
text: caltrop trap which temporarily slows you. Like most traps, it can be
text: disarmed by holding down Control while attempting to move into it
text: (or {commanding:Alter a grid} before moving). This also has a chance
text: of triggering the trap. Since it is not too dangerous, try to disarm
text: it until you succeed.

note:statistics note
text:Your character has four main statistics: Strength, Dexterity,
text: Constitution, and Grace. These are represented at the left of
text: the screen. The numbers can be positive or negative, with zero
text: representing the average for the humans of this age (the Edain).

note:strength note
text:Your Strength mainly affects the damage you deal. You can get an
text: extra side on each damage die for each point of Strength. Your
text: strength is 2, so you do 2d7 damage with the curved sword instead
text: of 2d5. You only do 1d8 damage with the shortsword though, as you
text: can get at most 1 extra side for each lb the weapon weighs.
text: Your abilities with your current weapon/bow/armour are listed on the
text: left of the screen too. Try switching weapons to see what happens.

note:constitution note
text:Your Constitution increases your maximum health. Unlike many other
text: games, in Sil it is the only thing that affects maximum health.
text: To survive the more challenging opponents, you will need to
text: get better at avoiding their attacks or absorbing the damage with armour.

note:dexterity note
text:As well as your Statistics, you have 8 skills open to you.
text: Your Dexterity affects the first four of these: Melee, Archery,
text: Evasion, and Stealth.

note:grace note
text:As well as your Statistics, you have 8 skills open to you.
text: Your Grace affects the last four of these: Perception, Will,
text: Smithing, and Song. It also increases your 'Voice' which is
text: a measure of how long you can keep singing a song of power.

note:character sheet note
text:To have a look at your character sheet, {command:Character description}.
text: This will show all of your Skills and much more. To exit just press
text: 'Escape' (which exits any menu or screen in Sil).

note:experience note
text:In Sil, your character gains experience from encountering enemies,
text: killing enemies, identifying items, and reaching new depths in
text: the dungeon. You can use the experience you have earned to increase
text: your Skills via the character sheet, but don't do so right now.

note:look note
text:Sometimes you won't know what a character on the screen represents.
text: To find out, {command:Look around}, which allows you to look at objects.

note:examine note
text:Sometimes you will have identified an item but still won't know exactly
text: what it does. You can find out more by {commanding:Examine an item} to
text: examine it.

note:help note
text:Sometimes you will forget which key does what or need a new command.
text: You can see a list of all the key commands by {commanding:Help}.

note:first part note
text:You now know more than enough to start playing Sil and can probably
text: pick up most things as you go along, with occasional references to the
text: manual if you want to know exactly how things work. If you'd like to
text: continue with the tutorial, just take the door to the north. If you'd
text: like to start a proper game, then go through the passage to the east.
text: If you want to skip this part of the tutorial next time, there is a
text: secret door to the south between the first room and this room.

note:staircase note
text:To use the staircase, {command:Go down staircase} when standing on it.

note:alertness note
text:Enemies in Sil have three levels of alertness. They can be asleep, unwary
text: or alert. When they are asleep, they don't move, and their Evasion score
text: is set to [-5]. When they are unwary, they move around oblivious to you,
text: and their evasion is halved. Remaining unnoticed can be a great advantage
text: in Sil. You can try to avoid all enemies, avoid only those you cannot
text: handle, or kill them in their sleep. It is even possible to play the game
text: without any combat if you are very careful.

note:stealth note
text:Your chance to remain unseen is primarily affected by your Stealth skill.
text: Enemies get a penalty to notice you based on how far away they are, with
text: closed doors counting as five squares.{paragraphbreak}
text:If you are within sight of an unwary enemy, it receives a bonus
text: to notice you, and this effect is increased for each floor square around
text: you. It thus pays to remain out of sight and behind closed doors, or
text: (if you must be in sight) to hide near the walls and corners of rooms.
text: Finally, there is a penalty for making loud noises, such as being
text: involved in combat.

note:stealth mode note
text:If it is critical to avoid attracting attention, you get a bonus for
text: staying still, or for moving slowly (Stealth mode). To switch this on
text: or off, {command:Toggle stealth mode}. Using Stealth mode and sticking
text: to the walls, see if you can evade thse Orc soldiers. If not, don't
text: despair -- stealth is not always easy.

note:diagonal note
text:It looks like there has been a cave-in here. To get through
text: you will need to move diagonally. This is easy with a keypad, but harder
text: on a laptop. To move diagonally, use the 1 3 7 9 keys at the top of the
text: keyboard. This can be a little tricky to learn, but it is often
text: convenient and sometimes essential. If you are very familiar with the
text: hjkl movement keys there is an option to use them instead in the options
text: menu ({command:Interact with options} to open that).

note:digging note
text:The corridor ahead is completely blocked, but there is a shovel here.
text: If you are carrying a shovel, you can press Control (or
text: {command:Alter a grid}) before moving into the blocked area to tunnel
text: through it. Deeper down you might find mattocks which can dig through
text: quartz veins and even some ways to dig through granite. It is strongly
text: recommended that you carry some means of digging when you venture down
text: into the depths, or you could become trapped.

note:singing note
text:Some characters learn to sing songs of power, which can
text: have great effect upon you, your enemies or even your environment.
text: Your character knows two songs: the Song of Slaying, which provides
text: a bonus to attack which gets larger the more creatures you kill, and
text: the Song of the Trees, which increases your light radius. Behind this
text: door you will find use for both of them. {Command:Change song} to begin
text: or end singing.

note:smithing note
text:Some characters master Smithing and create enchanted items.
text: To do so requires you to find a forge and when standing in it,
text: to {command:Smith an item}. Your character knows how to forge armour
text: and how to enchant it. Find the forge through this door and
text: create a set of boots of speed. As with most enchantments, you
text: have to lend a piece of yourself to make these, in this case the
text: price is 500 experience points.

note:post singing and smithing note
text:When you have learnt about Song and Smithing, go through this door.

note:abilities note
text:Each of the eight skills has a set of special Abilities tied to it.
text: Each type of song is an Ability for the Song skill. Armour Smithing
text: and Enchantment are Abilities for the Smithing skill. The boots of
text: quickness you made grant an Ability called Sprinting, linked to the
text: Evasion skill. They make you move more quickly if you spend several
text: turns moving in roughly the same direction.

note:using experience note
text:To look through the available Abilities, {command:Abilities list}. You
text: will see that each one has a required number of points in that Skill and
text: possibly some pre-requisite Abilities. Typically the first ability
text: in a skill costs 500 experience, then 1000, 1500, etc. You will have to
text: find the right balance between spending experience on Skill points
text: and on abilities. Now might be a good time to spend any experience
text: you have on Skills or Abilities.

note:final note
text:That's it. You know enough about Sil to really get started.
text: If you need to know any more, then have a look through the manual.
text: Through here lies your final challenge, and one that will
text: almost certainly mean your demise. See if you an make it past the
text: challenge and reach the staircase, using it by
text: {commanding:Go up staircase}.

note:easy exit note
text:You have finished the first half of the tutorial and are ready to
text: create a new character.
text:{paragraphbreak}Don't let the choices overwhelm you the first time.
text: Just start with the default Race and House, then invest most of your
text: starting experience in Melee and Evasion. Once the game begins,
text: finding some weapons and armour should be your top priority.
text:{paragraphbreak}Remember that a key feature of Sil (and all Roguelike

note:hard exit note
text:Congratulations. You have survived a fire-drake (usually found at
text: 900 ft!), and have finished the tutorial in fine form. You are
text: more than ready to create a new character.
text:{paragraphbreak}Don't let the choices overwhelm you the first time.
