# 'name' is for the ability name, and indicates the beginning of an ability
# entry.  Note that it is allowable two abilites with the same name to appear
# under different skills, but they should have exactly the same effect.
#
# 'level' is the level requirement for the ability.
#
# 'prerequisite' is skill name and ability name (both needed because some
# ability names are duplicated across skills) of any prerequisite abilities.

# 'type' is for possible tvals (object bases).  A 'type' line indicates
# that any object kind of that type can be used for this ability.

# 'item' is for possible tval-sval pairs, which correspond to object kinds.
